# About Myself
Hello! My name is Andr√©, I was born in 2000 in Curitiba, Brazil. I currently work as a developer and DevOps.

The main programming languages that I work with as a developer include, but not limited to:
- Python - Backend, mostly REST APIs for ML models and cloud provider connectors and Lambda functions
- JavaScript - Fullstack, but focused on backend: REST APIs, cloud provider connectors and Lambda functions
- C++ - Backend: REST APIs, high-performance applications and ML algorithms

The main resources I work with as a DevOps engineer include, but not limited to:
- AWS - The cloud provider I have most experience with, having a Solutions Architect Associate certificate
- Azure - Intermediate level, have experience managing Kubernetes clusters, pipelines and data storage options (Cosmos DB, Blob Storage, Key Vaults)
- GCP - Still a beginner, but I have run some experiments with Kubernetes and VMs with GPU on the platform
- Terraform - The main tool I use for IaC
- Docker - Application shipping
- Kubernetes - Service orchestration

I look forward to contributing to interesting projects and learning new things, from design patterns to whole new technologies and frameworks!
